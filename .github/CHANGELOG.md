**General improvements**
* Incremented wait time of containers' healthchecks to avoid to break clean installations
* Improvements to the "Scan page":
  * Added the chance to customize the runtime configuration of a Playbook
  * Moved TLP section from hidden in the "Advanced configuration" section to exposed by default
* Now every plugin can be configured with:
  * a "healthcheck": this can be useful to verify the status of the service.

## [v5.2.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v5.2.0)

This is mostly a stability and maintainance release.

We are happy to announce that we received support from Digital Ocean to host infrastructure for the community. :)
If you are interested in helping us setting up a public instance of IntelOwl, **free** for the community, with all the privacy policy and related required stuff, please contact us :)


**Important usability changes**
* We added a new section in the "Scan" page called "Recent Scans" which allows the users to better interact with its own and other users' already made analysis, improving the efficiency of the users and their communication.
* By default jobs are executed with `TLP:AMBER` which means that they are shared with the other members of your organization **only**. (previously the default was `TLP:CLEAR`). This is to avoid possible users errors.
* From now on, VT file analyzers send files to VT only when TLP is `CLEAR` and not anymore based on a specific parameter. As a consequence, `VirusTotal_v3_Get_File_And_Scan` is not available anymore. Please use the new `VirusTotal_v3_Get_File` instead and set the analysis to the correct TLP.
  * Same behavior has been extended to other analyzers: `Intezer_Scan`, `MWDB_Scan`, `Virushee_Upload_File` (renamed to `Virushee_Scan`), `YARAify_File_Scan`.

**General improvements**
* Added First Visit Guide
* Improved the documentation with the goal to help the users to understand better how all the available Plugins work.
* For OpenCTI users having problems in integrating IntelOwl, now you can use a workaround: [doc](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Advanced-Configuration.html#opencti)
* A new organization role is available to better manage the org: `admin`. [Doc](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.html#organizations-and-user-management)
* Improvements in the "Jobs History" table: now it shows executed Playbooks and file/observables types correctly.
* We added a new "Pivot" section in the "Plugin" GUI for the new Plugin type introduced in the [v5.1.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v5.1.0) release. We added a new dedicated visualizer which allows the user to see when a Pivot has been executed in the "Job Result" page. We are still working on it and planning to add more documentation and GUI usability soon.
* Improvements in the "Jobs Result" page: now playbooks are more relevant, warnings are shown next to errors, Raw JSON data has been moved next to the other raw data.
* Changed JSON viewer library because the old one was deprecated

**New/Improved Plugins:**
* deprecated `VirusTotal_v2_*` analyzers have been removed.
* added LOLDrivers Rules to ClamAV default signatures.
* added [Netlas.io](https://netlas.io/api) analyzer.
* removed CryptoScam analyzer because the service has been dismissed.
* added `timeout` to InQuest analyzers to avoid long time running jobs.
* fixed XLMMacroDeobfuscator always saying it decrypted the analyzed file even when the file was not encrypted.
* `Malpedia_Scan` has been deprecated and disabled because the service seems no more active.
* added more analyzers in the default `Sample_Static_Analysis` playbook.
* adjusted few analyzers: CAPESandbox, Dehashed, YARAify, GoogleWebRisk

**Fixes / adjusts / minor changes**
* Now "Restart" button in the Job Page does correctly work after having used a Playbook.
* basic support for IPv6
* big refactors both in the backend and the frontend
* lot of fixes everywhere ;)
* improved documentation
* upgraded a lot of packages


## [v5.1.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v5.1.0)
With this release we announce our new official site created by [Abheek Tripathy](https://twitter.com/abheekblahblah)!
Feel free to check it out! Official [blog post here](https://intelowlproject.github.io/blogs/official_site_revamped)!

**Important changes**
* We added a new type of Plugin called [Ingestor](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.html#ingestors). **Ingestors** allow to automatically insert IOC streams from outside sources to IntelOwl itself.
* Visualizers are not connected anymore to Analyzers/Connectors. They are connected to a single Playbook instead. This allows the users to create and manage the Visualizers in an easier way.
* We added the new **Pivot** framework in the backend which allows to connect jobs to each other and to _pivot_ from one indicator to another. This is the first step to give the chance to the users to create more broader and complex investigation in IntelOwl. The next step will be to add the Frontend changes that allows the user to fully leverage the framework 

**New/Improved Plugins:**
* Added new `DNS` playbook that collects the analyzers which performs DNS queries to various providers
* Added more option for `CapeSandbox` analyzer

**Fixes / adjusts / minor changes**
* added chance to change the password of the account from the personal section in the application
* added a lot of Frontend tests for the "Scan" page to improve stability
* some frontend changes to improve overall experience (#1743, #1741, #1754, #1772, #1780, #1807, #1806)
* added new partial statuses for the Job which allow to better track the job progression [#1740)]
* Added new public Yara rules
* updated installation instructions
* upgraded a lot of packages

## [v5.0.1](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v5.0.1)

**Bug fixing for the v5.0.0 release**
* The Scan Form button was not working. Now it works correctly.
* Added more frontend tests to reduce chances to introduce new bugs.

**Important notice for users migrating to the new major release**

A lot of database migrations needs to be applied during the upgrade. Just be patient few minutes once you install the new major release. If you get 500 status code errors in the GUI, just wait few minutes and then refresh the page.

**Minor changes**
* Upgrade Mandiant's Floss version

## [v5.0.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v5.0.0)
This major release is another big step forward for IntelOwl!! 🚀

Official blog post: [v.5.0.0 Announcement](https://www.certego.net/blog/intelowl-v5-released)

We heard your feedback! During the event at [Fosdem](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/security_intelowl/) we announced that we were working in adding an _aggregated and simplified visualization of analyzer results_.
We created it. Now, by leveraging a new plugin type called <b>Visualizers</b>, you will be able to create custom visualizations, based on your specific use cases!

This framework is extremely powerful and allows every user to customize the GUI as they wish. But you know...with great power comes great responsability. To fully leverage this framework, you would need to put some effort in place. You would need to understand which data is useful for you and then write few code lines that would create your own GUI.

That would speed the analysis of the results a lot if done correctly!

To aid in this process we added a lot of [documentation and some very simple pre-built analyzers that you can use as example](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.html#visualizers):

Moreover this release anticipates other important crucial steps for IntelOwl:
* On June 10th [Matteo Lodi](https://twitter.com/matte_lodi) and [Simone Berni](https://twitter.com/0ssig3no) are presenting IntelOwl at one of the most important Cyber Security events in Italy: [HackinBo](https://www.hackinbo.it/programma.php)
* On May 28th the [Google Summer of Code 2023](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) is starting and IntelOwl is participating again with 2 new students! Welcome to [Shivam Purohit](https://twitter.com/stay_away_plss) and [Abheek Tripathy](https://twitter.com/abheekblahblah)!

This release was possible thanks to the effort put in place by [Certego](https://www.certego.net) in supporting the maintainers.

**Other important changes:**

We have done some big refactor changes that could make your application do not work as expected after this major upgrade. Please follow the the [migration guide](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html#updating-to-5-0-0-from-a-4-x-x-version) before upgrading IntelOwl to the new major release.

* We moved away from the old big `analyzer_config.json` which was storing all the base configuration of the Analyzers to a database model (we did the same for all the other plugins types too). This allows us to manage plugins creation/modification/deletion in a more reliable manner and via the Django Admin Interface. If you have created custom plugins and changed those `<plugins>_config.json` file manually, you would need to re-create those custom plugins again from the Django Admin Interface.

* We have REMOVED all the environment configuration that we deprecated with the v4.0.0 release and the script to migrate them.
* We have REMOVED/RENAMED all the analyzers that we deprecated during the v4 releases cycle plus some more (see [migration guide](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html#updating-to-5-0-0-from-a-4-x-x-version)). You might need to change the analyzer names in your integrations.
* We did a lot of code refactors here and there to remove some spaghetti code that was generated by the high amount of different contributors that we had during the recent years. This should be transparent for the user

**Other added minor features**
* We added the chance to add comments to "Job Result" pages to improve collaboration.
* We made few modifications to the "Scan" page to improve the user experience:
  * By default, now the first available Playbook is executed and not all the available Analyzers anymore.
  * By default, Analysis are run with TLP:RED and not with TLP:WHITE anymore.
  * The Frontend automatically understand which type of observable you inserted.
  * We moved the "Extra configuration" at the bottom of the "Scan" page and left only options that make actual sense.
* We added a Notification alert that, if the users has Notifications enabled in the browser, would notify the user once an analysis has finished.

**New/Improved Analyzers:**
* Added more public Yara Rules (@dr4konia, @facebook) and we worked hard to optimize intensively Yara scanning. Now it should be super fast.
* Added [Sublime Security](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs) analyzer (new framework to analyze emails).
* Updated and refactored `Dnstwist` analyzer to support more recent added options and work more reliably.
* Fixes to several analyzers like VirusTotal, OTX, APKiD, ClamAV

**Fixes / adjust / minor changes**
* moved from TLP:WHITE to TLP:CLEAR
* several little fixes and adjustments here and there
* a lot of dependencies upgrades


## [v4.2.3](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v4.2.3)

**New features**
* Registration Page. Now you can configure your SMTP server (or AWS SES) to manage registration requests via email (user verification, password reset/change). This allows IntelOwl to be better suited for public deployments as a SaaS service.

**New/Improved Analyzers:**
* Refactored `Yara` analyzer again to avoid memory leaks and improve performance intensively
* [Crowdsec](https://www.crowdsec.net/) analyzer no longer fails if the IP address is not found
* Added new [Hunter_How](https://hunter.how/search-api) analyzer
* We refactored the `malware_tools_analyzers` container that contains a lot of malware analysis tools. Thanks to that we have fixed `Qiling` and `Capa_Info` analyzer and we have updated all the other ones available (`Floss`, `APKid`, `Thug`, etc) 

**fixes / adjust / minor changes**
* fixes to support for AWS Services (IAM authentication, AWS regions, AWS SQS)
* Added support for NFS storage
* minor fixes to a lot of different analyzers: `PDF_Info`, `Classic_DNS`, `Quad9`, `MWdb`, `OTX_Query`, etc
* fixes to `initialize.sh`
* now Observable name is copy pastable in the Job Result Page
* a lot of dependencies upgrade (like Django from v3.2 to v4.1)

**CARE!!!** After having upgraded IntelOwl, in case the application does not start and you get an error like this:
```commandline
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/log/intel_owl/django/authentication.log
```
just run this:
```commandline
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/docker/volumes/intel_owl_generic_logs/_data/django
```
and restart IntelOwl. It should solve the permissions problem.


## [v4.2.2](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v4.2.2)

The GUI was completely rewritten by one of our maintainer, [Eshaan Bansal](https://twitter.com/eshaan7_), in ReactJS, and the code included in the main IntelOwl repository. This was possible thanks to the effort put in place by [Certego](https://www.certego.net/) in supporting the maintainers.

The overall user feeling should be drastically improved. We hope you'll enjoy the new appearance of IntelOwl! Please try it out and provide us feedback!

**NEW FEATURES**

While developing the new GUI, our main goal was to at least provide the same features that were available before. Anyway, we had the chance to add some important features:

- A new way to manage users and their permissions: the "Organization" feature. Please refer to the [docs here](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.md#organizations-and-user-management).
- A notification mechanism was added. Please refer to the [docs here](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.md#notifications).
- Now it is possible to do more advanced lookups through the Jobs History and have an overall better way to filter them.
- A new "API Access/Sessions" section was added to facilitate the management of API tokens and User sessions.
- Now it is possible to submit multiple observables / files at the same time.

**RETROCOMPATIBILITY INFO AND HOW TO UPDATE**

Please refer to the [**Upgrade Guide**](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html#update-and-re-build)

**New/Improved Analyzers:**

> 🎉 We are glad to welcome [Tines](https://www.tines.com/?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=intelowl) as a new sponsor for IntelOwl. Read everything about this partnership [in the Tines' blog](https://www.tines.com/blog/announcing-our-sponsorship-of-intel-owl).

**Notes:**

- Update PyIntelOwl to version [4.1.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md#410).
- Introducing IntelOwl Official [Parternship & Sponsorship Tiers](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/blob/master/.github/partnership_and_sponsors.md).

  - Request Body:
    - deprecate `md5` attribute. Will now be calculated on server.
    - deprecate `tags_id` attribute in favor of `tags_labels`. Previously, the `tags_id` attribute would accept a list of tag indices, now the `tags_labels` accepts a list of tag labels (non-existing `Tag` objects are created automatically with a randomly generated color).
    - `observable_classification` attribute is now optional. If not passed, the application tries to guess the correct classification using regular expressions.
  - Response Body: now also returns a `connectors_running` attribute that is a list of connectors executed for the specific job.

**Misc:**

- Added default parameters to `entrypoint_flower.sh` to allow retrocompatibility.
- Fixes in documentation.

## [v3.0.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

> Note: This is a major release with MANY breaking changes.
>
> ✒️ [Link](https://www.honeynet.org/2021/09/13/intel-owl-release-v3-0-0/) to the blogpost announcing the release and summary of top new features.
>
> 💻 GUI changes can be seen in action on the [demo](https://intelowlclient.firebaseapp.com/pages/connectors).

**Notes:**

- Update PyIntelOwl to version [4.0.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md#400).
- If you modified your local `analyzer_config.json` file, then you will need to merge the changes manually because of the new format.

**Features:**

- Plugins (analyzers/connectors) that are not properly configured will not run even if requested. They will be marked as disabled from the dropdown on the analysis form and as a bonus you can also see if and why a plugin is not configured on the GUI tables.
- Added `kill`, `retry` and `healthcheck` features to analyzers and connectors. See [Managing Analyzers and Connectors](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/master/Usage.html#special-plugins-operations).
- Standardized threat-sharing using Traffic Light Protocol or `TLP`, thereby deprecating the use of booleans `force_privacy`, `disable_external_analyzers` and `private`. See [TLP Support](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/master/Usage.html#tlp-support). This makes the analysis form much more easier to use than before.

**New class of plugins called _Connectors_:**

- Connectors are designed to run after every successful analysis which makes them suitable for automated threat-sharing. Built to support integration with other SIEM/SOAR projects specifically aimed at Threat Sharing Platforms. See [Available Connectors](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/master/Usage.html#available-connectors).
- Newly added connectors for threat-sharing:
  - `MISP`: automatically creates an event on your MISP instance.
  - `OpenCTI`: automatically creates an observable and a linked report on your OpenCTI instance.
  - `YETI`: find/create an observable on YETI.
- New `connectors_config.json` file for storing connectors related configuration.

**New analyzers configuration format:**

- The `additional_config_params` attribute was split into the following 3 individual attributes.
  - `config`: Includes common parameters - `queue` and `soft_time_limit`.
  - `params`: Includes default value, datatype and description for each [Analyzer](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/master/Usage.html#analyzers-customization) or [Connector](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/master/Usage.html#connectors-customization) specific parameters that modify runtime behaviour.
  - `secrets`: Includes analyzer or connector specific secrets (e.g. API Key) name along with the secret's description. All secrets are required.

**New inbuilt analyzers/fixes to existing:**

- New `Spyse` analyzer: Scan domains, IPs, emails and CVEs using Spyse's API. Register [here](https://spyse.com/user/registration).
- New `OpenCTI` analyzer: scan an observable on an OpenCTI instance.
- New `Intezer_Get` analyzer: check Managing Analyzers and Connectors if an analysis related to a hash is available in [Intezer](https://analyze.intezer.com/?utm_source=IntelOwl)
- New `MWDB_Get` analyzer: [mwdblib](https://mwdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Retrieve malware file analysis by hash from repository maintained by CERT Polska MWDB.
- New `YETI` analyzer (YETI = Your Everyday Threat Intelligence): scan an observable on a YETI instance.
- New `HashLookupServer_Get_Observable` and `HashLookupServer_Get_File` analyzers: check if a md5 or sha1 is available in the database of [known file hosted by CIRCL](https://github.com/adulau/hashlookup-server)
- New `ClamAV` analyzer: scan files for viruses/malwares/trojans using [ClamAV antivirus engine](https://docs.clamav.net/).
- Fixed `Tranco` Analyzer pointing to the wrong `python_module`
- Removed `CirclePDNS` default value in `env_file_app_template`
- VirusTotal v3: New configuration options: `include_behaviour_summary` for behavioral analysis and `include_sigma_analyses` for sigma analysis report of the file. See [Customize Analyzers](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/master/Advanced-Usage.html#customize-analyzer-execution).

**REST API changes:**

- The `/api/send_analysis_request` endpoint was split into two individual endpoints, namely, `/api/analyze_file` and `/api/analyze_observable` to allow for various improvements.
- Updated endpoint for downloading job sample: `/api/jobs/{id}/download_sample`
- Updated `/api/ask_analysis_availability` to be a `POST` endpoint to allow for various improvements.

**Misc:**

- Updated the elasticsearch mapping for `Job` model along with updated [Saved Object](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/blob/master/configuration/Kibana-Saved-Conf.ndjson) for Kibana.

## [v2.5.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v2.5.0)

**New Inbuilt Analyzers:**

- New `Dehashed_Search` analyzer: Query any observable/keyword against Dehashed's search API (https://dehashed.com).
