## [v2.1.1](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v2.1.1)

## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v2.1.0)
**IMPORTANT FIX**
We changed `docker-compose` file names for optional analyzers. In the `v.2.0.0` this broke Docker Hub builds, causing them to fail. Please upgrade to this version to be able to use the optional analyzers again.

**NEW INBUILT ANALYZERS:**
- added [CRXCavator](https://crxcavator.io/) analyzer for malicious Chrome extensions
- added [CERT Polska MWDB](https://mwdb.cert.pl) analyzer for malicious files

**FIXES/IMPROVEMENTS/Dependency upgrades:**
- updated `Quark_Engine` to last version and fixed rules
- `Maxmind` analyzer now retrieves City data too
- fixes for `Qiling` analyzer
- re-enabled `APKiD_Scan_APK_DEX_JAR` analyzer for Android samples
- adjusts to auto-build, PR template and documentation

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
**BREAKING CHANGES:**
- moved docker and docker-compose files under `docker/` folder.
- users upgrading from previous versions need to manually move `env_file_app`, `env_file_postgres` and `env_file_integrations` files under `docker/`.
- users are to use the new [start.py](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Installation.html#run) method to build or start IntelOwl containers
- moved the following analyzers together in a specific optional docker container named `static_analyzers`.
  - [`Capa`](https://github.com/fireeye/capa)
  - [`PeFrame`](https://github.com/guelfoweb/peframe)
  - `Strings_Info_Classic` (based on [flarestrings](https://github.com/fireeye/stringsifter))
  - `Strings_Info_ML` (based on [stringsifter](https://github.com/fireeye/stringsifter))

**NEW INBUILT ANALYZERS:**
- added [Qiling](https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling) file analyzer. This is an optional analyzer (see [docs](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Advanced-Usage.html#optional-analyzers) to understand how to activate it).
