## Partnership and sponsors

As open source project maintainers, we strongly rely on external support to get the resources and time to work on keeping the project alive, with a constant release of new features, bug fixes and general improvements.

Sometimes it is not simple and easy for the community of individuals and companies to understand how to support properly a project like IntelOwl.

For this reason we have launched an official program for partnerships and sponsors.

There are 4 level of contributions that you may apply for:

* <b>IRON</b> (For individuals only): with just 5$ a month, we will be happy to add your name in the README in the [dedicated section](https://github.com/certego/IntelOwl/blob/master/README.md#IRON) and solve priority issues and problems you may find while using IntelOwl
* <b>BRONZE</b>: Basic plan for companies. Logo, link to homepage and name of the company written in the README. Priority for issues and new features
* <b>SILVER</b>: Additional space in the README and/or documentation to explain use cases of the sponsor (link to articles, etc)
* <b>GOLD</b>: This is for those who wants to be directly involved in the evolution, future and direction of the project.


For BRONZE, SILVER and GOLD sponsorship we ask those interested to contact us via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intel_owl) to discuss the terms and conditions.

Contributions are accepted via Liberapay.
