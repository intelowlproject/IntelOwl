# Checklist

- [ ] I have read and understood the rules about [how to Contribute](https://intelowlproject.github.io/docs/IntelOwl/contribute/) to this project
- [ ] The pull request is for the branch `develop`
- [ ] A new plugin (analyzer, connector, visualizer, playbook, pivot or ingestor) was added or changed, in which case:
    - [ ] I strictly followed the documentation ["How to create a Plugin"](https://intelowlproject.github.io/docs/IntelOwl/contribute/#how-to-add-a-new-plugin)
    - [ ] [Usage](https://github.com/intelowlproject/docs/blob/main/docs/IntelOwl/usage.md) file was updated. A link to the PR to the [docs](https://github.com/intelowlproject/docs) repo has been added as a comment here.
    - [ ] [Advanced-Usage](https://github.com/intelowlproject/docs/blob/main/docs/IntelOwl/advanced_usage.md) was updated (in case the plugin provides additional optional configuration). A link to the PR to the [docs](https://github.com/intelowlproject/docs) repo has been added as a comment here.
    - [ ] I have dumped the configuration from Django Admin using the `dumpplugin` command and added it in the project as a data migration. (["How to share a plugin with the community"](https://intelowlproject.github.io/docs/IntelOwl/contribute/#how-to-share-your-plugin-with-the-community))
    - [ ] If a File analyzer was added and it supports a mimetype which is not already supported, you added a sample of that type inside the archive `test_files.zip` and you added the default tests for that mimetype in [test_classes.py](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/blob/master/tests/api_app/analyzers_manager/test_classes.py).
    - [ ] If you created a new analyzer and it is free (does not require any API key), please add it in the `FREE_TO_USE_ANALYZERS` playbook by following [this guide](https://intelowlproject.github.io/docs/IntelOwl/contribute/#how-to-modify-a-plugin).
    - [ ] Check if it could make sense to add that analyzer/connector to other [freely available playbooks](https://intelowlproject.github.io/docs/IntelOwl/usage/#list-of-pre-built-playbooks).
    - [ ] I have provided the resulting raw JSON of a finished analysis and a screenshot of the results.
    - [ ] If the plugin interacts with an external service, I have created an attribute called precisely `url` that contains this information. This is required for Health Checks. 
    - [ ] If the plugin requires mocked testing, `_monkeypatch()` was used in its class to apply the necessary decorators.
    - [ ] I have added that raw JSON sample to the `MockUpResponse` of the `_monkeypatch()` method. This serves us to provide a valid sample for testing.
    - [ ] I have created the corresponding `DataModel` for the new analyzer following the [documentation](https://intelowlproject.github.io/docs/IntelOwl/contribute/#how-to-create-a-datamodel)
- [ ] I have inserted the copyright banner at the start of the file: ```# This file is a part of IntelOwl https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl # See the file 'LICENSE' for copying permission.```
- [ ] If external libraries/packages with restrictive licenses were used, they were added in the [Legal Notice](https://github.com/certego/IntelOwl/blob/master/.github/legal_notice.md) section.
- [ ] Linters (`Black`, `Flake`, `Isort`) gave 0 errors. If you have correctly installed [pre-commit](https://intelowlproject.github.io/docs/IntelOwl/contribute/#how-to-start-setup-project-and-development-instance), it does these checks and adjustments on your behalf.
- [ ] I have added tests for the feature/bug I solved (see `tests` folder). All the tests (new and old ones) gave 0 errors.
- [ ] If the GUI has been modified:
    - [ ] I have a provided a screenshot of the result in the PR.
    - [ ] I have created new frontend tests for the new component or updated existing ones.
- [ ] After you had submitted the PR, if `DeepSource`, `Django Doctors` or other third-party linters have triggered any alerts during the CI checks, I have solved those alerts.
