# Intel Owl

Do you want to get **threat intelligence data** about a malware, an IP or a domain? Do you want to get this kind of data from multiple sources at the same time using **a single API request**?

You are in the right place!

Intel Owl is an Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT solution to get threat intelligence data about a specific file, an IP or a domain from a single API at scale. It integrates a number of analyzers available online and a lot of cutting-edge malware analysis tools. It is for everyone who needs a single point to query for info about a specific file or observable.

### Features

- Provides enrichment of Threat Intel for malware as well as observables (IP, Domain, URL, hash, etc).
- This application is built to **scale out** and to **speed up the retrieval of threat info**.
- Thanks to the official libraries [pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl) and [go-intelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/go-intelowl), it can be integrated easily in your stack of security tools to automate common jobs usually performed, for instance, by SOC analysts manually.
- Intel Owl is composed of:
  - **analyzers** that can be run to either retrieve data from external sources (like VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB) or to generate intel from internally available tools (like Yara or Oletools)
  - **connectors** that can be run to export data to external platforms (like MISP or OpenCTI)
  - **visualizers** that can be run to create custom visualizations of analyzers results
  - **playbooks** that are meant to make analysis easily repeatable
- API REST written in Django and Python 3.9.
- Built-in frontend client written in ReactJS, with **[certego-ui](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui)**: provides features such as dashboard, visualizations of analysis data, easy to use forms for requesting new analysis, etc.
