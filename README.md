# Intel Owl

Do you want to get **threat intelligence data** about a file, an IP or a domain?

Do you want to get this kind of data from multiple sources at the same time using **a single API request**?

You are in the right place!

This application is built to **scale out** and to **speed up the retrieval of threat info**.

It can be integrated easily in your stack of security tools to automate common jobs usually performed, for instance, by SOC analysts manually.

Intel Owl is composed of **analyzers** that can be run to retrieve data from external sources (like VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB) or to generate intel from internal analyzers (like Yara or Oletools)

This solution is for everyone who needs a single point to query for info about a specific file or observable (domain, IP, URL, hash).

Main features:
- full django-python application
- easily and completely customizable, both the APIs and the analyzers
- clone the project, set up the configuration and you are ready to run
