# Intel Owl

Do you want to get **threat intelligence data** about a malware, an IP address or a domain? Do you want to get this kind of data from multiple sources at the same time using **a single API request**?

You are in the right place!

IntelOwl is an Open Source solution for management of Threat Intelligence at scale. It integrates a number of analyzers available online and a lot of cutting-edge malware analysis tools.

### Features
This application is built to **scale out** and to **speed up the retrieval of threat info**.

It provides:
- **Enrichment of Threat Intel** for files as well as observables (IP, Domain, URL, hash, etc).
- A Fully-fledged REST APIs written in Django and Python.
- An easy way to be integrated in your stack of security tools to automate common jobs usually performed, for instance, by SOC analysts manually. (Thanks to the official libraries [pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl) and [go-intelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/go-intelowl))
- A **built-in GUI**: provides features such as dashboard, visualizations of analysis data, easy to use forms for requesting new analysis, etc.
- A **framework** composed of modular components called **Plugins**:
  - *analyzers* that can be run to either retrieve data from external sources (like VirusTotal or AbuseIPDB) or to generate intel from internally available tools (like Yara or Oletools)
  - *connectors* that can be run to export data to external platforms (like MISP or OpenCTI)
  - *pivots* that are designed to trigger the execution of a chain of analysis and connect them to each other
  - *visualizers* that are designed to create custom visualizations of analyzers results
  - *ingestors* that allows to automatically ingest stream of observables or files to IntelOwl itself
  - *playbooks* that are meant to make analysis easily repeatable
