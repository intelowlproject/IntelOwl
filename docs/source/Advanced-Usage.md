## Optional Analyzers

Some analyzers which run in their own Docker containers are kept disabled by default. They are disabled by default to prevent accidentally starting too many containers and making your computer unresponsive.

To enable all the optional analyzers you can add the option `--all_analyzers` when starting the project. Example:

```bash
python3 start.py prod --all_analyzers up
```

Otherwise you can enable just one of the cited integration by using the related option. Example:

```bash
python3 start.py prod --tor_analyzers up
```

## Customize analyzer execution

Some analyzers and connectors provide the chance to customize the performed analysis based on parameters (`params` attr in the configuration file) that are different for each analyzer.

- You can set a custom default values by changing their `value` attribute directly from the configuration files. Since IntelOwl v4, it is possible to change these values directly from the GUI in the section "Your plugin configuration".
- You can choose to provide runtime configuration when requesting an analysis that will be merged with the default overriding it. This override is done only for the specific analysis.

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
Connectors parameters can only be changed from either their configuration file or the "Your plugin configuration" section, not at the time of analysis request.
</div>

##### View and understand different parameters

To see the list of these parameters:

- You can view the "Plugin" Section in IntelOwl to have a complete and updated view of all the options available
- You can view the raw JSON configuration file, [here](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/blob/master/configuration/analyzer_config.json).

##### from the GUI

You can click on "**CUSTOMIZE ANALYZERS PARAMETERS**" button and add the runtime configuration in the form of a dictionary.
Example:

```javascript
"VirusTotal_v3_Get_File": {
    "force_active_scan_if_old": true
}
```

##### from [Pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl)

While using `send_observable_analysis_request` or `send_file_analysis_request` endpoints, you can pass the parameter `runtime_configuration` with the optional values.
Example:

```python
runtime_configuration = {
    "Doc_Info": {
        "additional_passwords_to_check": ["passwd", "2020"]
    }
}
pyintelowl_client.send_file_analysis_request(..., runtime_configuration=runtime_configuration)
```

#### CyberChef

You can either use pre-defined recipes or create your own as
explained [here](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef-server#features).

To use a pre-defined recipe, set the `predefined_recipe_name` argument to the name of the recipe as
defined [here](#pre-defined-recipes). Else, leave the `predefined_recipe_name` argument empty and set
the `custom_recipe` argument to the contents of
the [recipe](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef-server#example-one-operation-non-default-arguments-by-name) you want to
use.

Additionally, you can also (optionally) set the `output_type` argument.

##### Pre-defined recipes

- "to decimal": `[{"op": "To Decimal", "args": ["Space", False]}]`

## Analyzers with special configuration

Some analyzers could require a special configuration:

- `GoogleWebRisk`: this analyzer needs a service account key with the Google Cloud credentials to work properly.
  You should follow the [official guide](https://cloud.google.com/web-risk/docs/quickstart) for creating the key.
  Then you can populate the secret `service_account_json` for that analyzer with the JSON of the service account file.

- `ClamAV`: this Docker-based analyzer uses `clamd` daemon as its scanner and is communicating with `clamdscan` utility to scan files. The daemon requires 2 different configuration files: `clamd.conf`(daemon's config) and `freshclam.conf` (virus database updater's config). These files are mounted as docker volumes in `/integrations/malware_tools_analyzers/clamav` and hence, can be edited by the user as per needs, without restarting the application. Moreover ClamAV is integrated with unofficial open source signatures extracted with [Fangfrisch](https://github.com/rseichter/fangfrisch). The configuration file `fangfrisch.conf` is mounted in the same directory and can be customized on your wish. For instance, you should change it if you want to integrate open source signatures from [SecuriteInfo](https://www.securiteinfo.com/) 

- `Suricata`: you can customize the behavior of Suricata:

  - `/integrations/pcap_analyzers/config/suricata/rules`: here there are Suricata rules. You can change the `custom.rules` files to add your own rules at any time. Once you made this change, you need to either restart IntelOwl or (this is faster) run a new analysis with the Suricata analyzer and set the parameter `reload_rules` to `true`.
  - `/integrations/pcap_analyzers/config/suricata/etc`: here there are Suricata configuration files. Change it based on your wish. Restart IntelOwl to see the changes applied.

- `Yara`: 
  - You can customize both the `public_repositories` parameter and `private_repositories` secret to download and use different rules from the default that IntelOwl currently support.
  - You can add local rules inside the directory at `/opt/deploy/files_required/yara/YOUR_USERNAME/custom_rules/`. Please remember that these rules are not synced in a cluster deploy: for this reason is advised to upload them on GitHub and use the `public_repositories` or `private_repositories` attributes. 

## Organizations and data sharing

Organizations are a great way to share data and analysis only with the members of your team. Invite the people you work with in your organization!

By default, analysis (jobs) are executed with a level of TLP that is CLEAR. This means that these jobs are public and every IntelOwl user can see them.
Thanks to the "Organization" feature, you can restrict the people who can see the analysis that you made.

How you can do that?
Jobs with either AMBER or RED TLP value will be accessible to only members within the same organization. You can select the TLP for the analysis at the time of request.

## Notifications

Since v4, IntelOwl integrated the notification system from the `certego_saas` package, allowing the admins to create notification that every user will be able to see.

The user would find the Notifications button on the top right of the page:

<img style="border: 0.2px solid black" width=220 height=210 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/master/docs/static/notifications.png">

There the user can read notifications provided by either the administrators or the IntelOwl Maintainers.

As an Admin, if you want to add a notification to have it sent to all the users, you have to login to the Django Admin interface, go to the "Notifications" section and add it there.
While adding a new notification, in the `body` section it is possible to even use HTML syntax, allowing to embed images, links, etc;
in the `app_name field`, please remember to use `intelowl` as the app name.

Everytime a new release is installed, once the backend goes up it will automatically create a new notification,
having as content the latest changes described in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md),
allowing the users to keep track of the changes inside intelowl itself.
