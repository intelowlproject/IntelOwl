# Usage

## Client
Intel Owl main objective is to provide a single API interface to query in order to retrieve threat intelligence at scale.

There are multiple ways to interact with the Intel Owl APIs,

1. IntelOwl-ng (Web Interface)

    - Inbuilt Web interface with dashboard, visualizations of analysis data, easy to use forms for requesting new analysis, tags management and more features
    - [Live Demo](https://intelowlclient.firebaseapp.com/)
    - Built with Angular 10+ and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/intelowlproject/intelowl-ng).

2. pyIntelOwl (CLI/SDK)

    - Official client that is available at: [PyIntelOwl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl),
    - Can be used as a library for your own python projects or...
    - directly via the command line interface.

<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint: Tokens Creation</p>
The server authentication is managed by API tokens. So, if you want to interact with Intel Owl, you have to create one or more unprivileged users from the Django Admin Interface and then generate a token for those users.
Afterwards you can leverage the created tokens with the Intel Owl Client.

## Analyzers customization
You can create new analyzers based on already existing modules by changing the configuration values inside `configuration/analyzer_config.json`. This file is mounted as a docker volume, so you won't need to rebuild the image.

You may want to change this configuration to add new analyzers or to change the configuration of some of them. The name of the analyzers can be changed at every moment based on your wishes.

The following are all the keys that you can change without touching the source code:
* `disabled`: you can choose to disable certain analyzers, then they won't appear in the dropdown list and won't run if requested.
* `leaks_info`: if set, in the case you specify via the API that a resource is sensitive, the specific analyzer won't be executed
* `external_service`: if set, in the case you specify via the API to exclude external services, the specific analyzer won't be executed
* `supported_filetypes`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze a file with a different mimetype from the ones you specified, it won't be executed
* `not_supported_filetypes`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze a file with a mimetype from the ones you specified, it won't be executed
* `observable_supported`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze an observable that is not in this list, it won't be executed. Valid values are: `ip`, `domain`, `url`, `hash`, `generic`.
* `soft_time_limit`: this is the maximum time (in seconds) of execution for an analyzer. Once reached, the task will be killed (or managed in the code by a custom Exception). Default `300`.
* `queue`: this takes effects only when [multi-queue](Advanced-Usage.html#multi-queue) is enabled. Choose which celery worker would execute the task: `local` (ideal for tasks that leverage local applications like Yara), `long` (ideal for long tasks) or `default` (ideal for simple webAPI-based analyzers).

<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint: Advanced Configuration</p>
You can also modify analyzer specific parameters from the configuration file or even at the time of requesting an analysis. See <a href="./Advanced-Usage.html#customize-analyzer-execution-at-time-of-request">Customize analyzer execution at time of request</a>
</div>

##### Example: add an analyzer configuration for your own Yara signatures
```json
    "Yara_Scan_Custom_Signatures": {
        "type": "file",
        "python_module": "yara.Yara",
        "description": "Executes Yara with custom signatures",
        "config": {
            "queue": "default",
            "soft_time_limit": 100,
        },
        "params": {
            "directories_with_rules": ["/opt/deploy/yara/custom_signatures"]
        }
    }
```

## Connectors customization
Connectors being optional are `disabled` by default. You can enable them by changing the configuration values inside `configuration/connector_config.json`. This file is mounted as a docker volume, so you won't need to rebuild the image.

The following are all the keys that you can change without touching the source code:
* `disabled`: _similar to analyzers_
* `soft_time_limit`: _similar to analyzers_
* `queue`: _similar to analyzers_
* `maximum_tlp` (default `WHITE`, choices `WHITE`, `GREEN`, `AMBER`, `RED`): specify with the maximum TLP of the analysis upto which the connector is allowed to run. (e.g. if `maximum_tlp` is `GREEN`, it would run for analysis with TLPs `WHITE` and `GREEN`). To learn more about TLPs see [TLP Support](./Usage.md#tlp-support).

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
Changing other keys can break an analyzer or connector. In that case, you should think about duplicating the configuration entry or python module with your changes.
</div>


## Managing Analyzers and Connectors
All plugins i.e. analyzers and connectors have `kill` and `retry` actions. In addition to that, all docker-based analyzers and connectors have a `healthcheck` action to check if their associated instances are up or not. 

- **kill:**

   To stop a plugin whose status is `running`/`pending`: 
   * GUI: Buttons on reports table on job result page.
   * PyIntelOwl: `IntelOwl.kill_analyzer` and `IntelOwl.kill_connector` function.
   * CLI: `$ pyintelowl jobs kill-analyzer <job_id> <analyzer_name>` and `$ pyintelowl jobs kill-connector <job_id> <connector_name>`
   * API: `PATCH /api/job/{job_id}/analyzer/{analyzer_name}/kill` and `PATCH /api/job/{job_id}/connector/{connector_name}/kill`
- **retry:**

   To retry a plugin whose status is `failed`/`killed`: 
   * GUI: Buttons on reports table on job result page.
   * PyIntelOwl: `IntelOwl.retry_analyzer` and `IntelOwl.retry_connector` function,
   * CLI: `$ pyintelowl jobs retry-analyzer <job_id> <analyzer_name>` and `$ pyintelowl jobs retry-connector <job_id> <connector_name>`
   * API: `PATCH /api/job/{job_id}/analyzer/{analyzer_name}/retry` and `PATCH /api/job/{job_id}/connector/{connector_name}/retry`
- **healthcheck:**

   To check if docker container or external platform associated with an analyzer or connector respectively are up or not: 
   * GUI: Buttons on analyzers table and connectors table.
   * PyIntelOwl: `IntelOwl.analyzer_healthcheck` and `IntelOwl.connector_healthcheck` methods.
   * CLI: `$ pyintelowl analyzer-healthcheck <analyzer_name>` and `$ pyintelowl connector-healthcheck <connector_name>`
   * API: `GET /api/analyzer/{analyzer_name}/healthcheck` and `GET /api /connector/{connector_name}/healthcheck`


## TLP Support
IntelOwl supports the **Traffic Light Protocol** (TLP) to facilitate sharing of job analysis results.

Following are the indicators available when requesting an analysis (in the order of increasing sharing restrictions):
1. `WHITE`: no restriction
2. `GREEN`: disable analyzers that could impact privacy
3. `AMBER`: disable analyzers that could impact privacy and limit view permissions to my group
4. `RED`: disable analyzers that could impact privacy, limit view permissions to my group and do not use any external service

These indicators when used with `maximum_tlp` (option available in connectors), give you the control of what information is shared to the external platforms.

[Additional analyzers](Advanced-Usage.html#optional-analyzers) that can be enabled per your wish.


## Available Connectors
Connectors are designed to run after every successful analysis which makes them suitable for automated threat-sharing. They support integration with other SIEM/SOAR projects, specifically aimed at Threat Sharing Platforms.

### Connectors list
The following is the list of the available connectors. You can also navigate the same list via the,

- [live demo](https://intelowlclient.firebaseapp.com/pages/connectors/table) for better UX.
- [pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl): `$ pyintelowl get-connector-config`


* `MISP`: automatically creates an event on your MISP instance, linking the successful analysis on IntelOwl.
