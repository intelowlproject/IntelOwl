# Usage

## Client
Intel Owl main objective is to provide a single API interface to query in order to retrieve threat intelligence at scale.

So, in order to interact with the Intel Owl APIs, you may want to use the specific client that is available at: [PyIntelOwl](https://github.com/mlodic/pyintelowl)

We suggest to download the client, read the instructions and use it as a library for your own python projects or directly from the command line.

### Tokens creation
The server authentication is managed by API keys. So, if you want to interact with Intel Owl, you have to create one or more unprivileged users from the Django Admin Interface and then generate a token for those users.
Afterwards you can leverage the created tokens with the Intel Owl Client.

## Available Analyzers

### Get all available analyzers
You can programmatically retrieve all the available analyzers with the official client [PyIntelOwl](https://github.com/mlodic/pyintelowl).

* Threatminer_Subdomains: retrieve subdomains from Threatminer API

## Analyzers customization
You can create new analyzers based on already existing modules by changing the configuration values (`analyzer_config.json`).

The following are all the keys that you can change without touching the source code:
* `leaks_info`: if set, in the case you specify via the API that a resource is sensitive, the specific analyzer won't be executed
* `external_service`: if set, in the case you specify via the API to exclude external services, the specific analyzer won't be executed
* `supported_filetypes`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze a file with a different mimetype from the ones you specified, it won't be executed
* `not_supported_filetypes`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze a file with a mimetype from the ones you specified, it won't be executed
* `observable_supported`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze an observable that is not in this list, it won't be executed. Valid values are: `ip`, `domain`, `url`, `hash`

Also, you can change the name of every available analyzer based on your wishes.

Changing other keys will break the analyzer. In that case, you should think about create a new python module or to modify an existing one.
