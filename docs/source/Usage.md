## Client

Intel Owl main objective is to provide a single API interface to query in order to retrieve threat intelligence at scale.

There are multiple ways to interact with the Intel Owl APIs,

1. Web Interface

   - Built-in Web interface with dashboard, visualizations of analysis data, easy to use forms for requesting new analysis, tags management and more features
   - Built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and based on [certego-ui](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui).

2. pyIntelOwl (CLI/SDK)

   - Official Python client that is available at: [PyIntelOwl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl),
   - Can be used as a library for your own python projects or...
   - directly via the command line interface.

3. goIntelOwl (CLI/SDK)
   - Official GO client that is available at: [go-intelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/go-intelowl)

<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint: Tokens Creation</p>
The server authentication is managed by API tokens. So, if you want to interact with Intel Owl, you have two ways to do that:
<ul>
<li>If you are a normal user, you can go to the "API Access/Sessions" section of the GUI and create a Token there.</li>
<li>If you are an administrator of IntelOwl, you can create one or more unprivileged users from the Django Admin Interface and then generate a token for those users.
</li>
</ul>
Afterwards you can leverage the created tokens with the Intel Owl Client.
</div>

## Organizations and User management

Starting from IntelOwl v4, a new "Organization" section is available on the GUI. This section substitute the previous permission management via Django Admin and aims to provide an easier way to manage users and visibility.

### Multi Tenancy

Thanks to the "Organization" feature, IntelOwl can be used by multiple SOCs, companies, etc...very easily.
Right now it works very simply: only users in the same organization can see analysis of one another. An user can belong to an organization only.

#### Manage organizations

You can create a new organization by going to the "Organization" section, available under the Dropdown menu you cand find under the username.

Once you create an organization, you are the unique Administrator of that organization. So you are the only one who can delete the organization, remove users and send invitations to other users.

#### Accept Invites

Once an invite has sent, the invited user has to login, go to the "Organization" section and accept the invite there. Afterwards the Administrator will be able to see the user in his "Organization" section.

#### Plugins Params and Secrets

From IntelOwl v4.1.0, Plugin Parameters and Secrets can be defined at the organization level, in the dedicated section.
This allows to share configurations between users of the same org while allowing complete multi-tenancy of the application.

#### Disable Analyzers at Org level

From IntelOwl v4.1.0, the org admin can disable specific analyzers for all the users in a specific org.
To do that, org admins needs to go in the "Plugins" section and click the button "Enabled for organization" of the analyzer that they want to disable.

### Registration
Since IntelOwl v4.2.0 we added a Registration Page that can be used to manage Registration requests when providing IntelOwl as a Service.

After a user registration has been made, an email is sent to the user to verify their email address. If necessary, there are buttons on the login page to resend the verification email and to reset the password.

Once the user has verified their email, they would be manually vetted before being allowed to use the IntelOwl platform. The registration requests would be handled in the Django Admin page by admins.
If you have IntelOwl deployed on an AWS instance with an IAM role you can use the [SES](/Advanced-Usage.md#ses) service.

To have the "Registration" page to work correctly, you must configure some variables before starting IntelOwl. See [Optional Environment Configuration](/Installation.md#other-optional-configuration-to-enable-specific-services-features)

In a development environment the emails that would be sent are written to the standard output.

#### Recaptcha configuration
The Registration Page contains a Recaptcha form from Google. By default, that Recaptcha is not configured and is not shown.

If your intention is to publish IntelOwl as a Service you should first remember to comply to the [AGPL License](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/blob/master/LICENSE).

Then you need to add the generated Recaptcha Secret in the `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY_IO_PUBLIC` value in the `env_file_app` file. Plus you would need to remember to set to `True` the `PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT` variable too.

Afterwards you should configure the Recaptcha Key for your site and add that value in the `RECAPTCHA_SITEKEY` in the `frontend/public/env.js` file.
In that case, you would need to [re-build](/Installation.md#update-and-rebuild) the application to have the changes properly reflected.

## Plugins

Plugins are the core modular components of IntelOwl that can be easily added, changed and customized.
There are 3 types of plugins:

- [Analyzers](#analyzers)
- [Connectors](#connectors)
- [Visualizers](#visualizers)
- [Playbooks](#playbooks)

### Analyzers

Analyzers are the most important plugins in IntelOwl. They allow to perform data extraction on the observables and/or files that you would like to analyze.

#### Analyzers list

The following is the list of the available analyzers you can run out-of-the-box. You can also navigate the same list via the

- Graphical Interface: once your application is up and running, go to the "Plugins" section
- [pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl): `$ pyintelowl get-analyzer-config`

##### Optional analyzers

[Some analyzers are optional](Advanced-Usage.html#optional-analyzers) and need to be enabled explicitly.

#### Analyzers Customization

You can create, modify, delete analyzers based on already existing modules by changing the configuration values inside the Django Admin interface at: `/admin/connectors_manager/analyzerreport/`.

The following are all the keys that you can change without touching the source code:
- `name`: Name of the analyzer
- `description`: Description of the analyzer
- `python_module`: Python path of the class that will be executed 
- `disabled`: you can choose to disable certain analyzers, then they won't appear in the dropdown list and won't run if requested.
- `leaks_info`: if set, in the case you specify via the API that a resource is sensitive, the specific analyzer won't be executed
- `external_service`: if set, in the case you specify via the API to exclude external services, the specific analyzer won't be executed
- `supported_filetypes`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze a file with a different mimetype from the ones you specified, it won't be executed
- `not_supported_filetypes`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze a file with a mimetype from the ones you specified, it won't be executed
- `observable_supported`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze an observable that is not in this list, it won't be executed. Valid values are: `ip`, `domain`, `url`, `hash`, `generic`.
- `config`:
  - `soft_time_limit`: this is the maximum time (in seconds) of execution for an analyzer. Once reached, the task will be killed (or managed in the code by a custom Exception). Default `300`.
  - `queue`: this takes effects only when [multi-queue](Advanced-Configuration.html#multi-queue) is enabled. Choose which celery worker would execute the task: `local` (ideal for tasks that leverage local applications like Yara), `long` (ideal for long tasks) or `default` (ideal for simple webAPI-based analyzers).
Sometimes, it may happen that you would like to create a new analyzer very similar to an already existing one. Maybe you would like to just change the description and the default parameters.
A helpful way to do that without having to copy/pasting the entire configuration, is to click on the analyzer that you want to copy, make the desired changes, and click the `save as new` button.

You can also modify analyzer specific parameters directly from the GUI. See <a href="./Advanced-Usage.html#customize-analyzer-execution">Customize analyzer execution at time of request</a>

### Connectors

Connectors are designed to run after every successful analysis which makes them suitable for automated threat-sharing. They support integration with other SIEM/SOAR projects, specifically aimed at Threat Sharing Platforms.

#### Connectors list

The following is the list of the available connectors. You can also navigate the same list via the

- Graphical Interface: once your application is up and running, go to the "Plugins" section
- [pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl): `$ pyintelowl get-connector-config`

##### List of pre-built Connectors

- `MISP`: automatically creates an event on your MISP instance, linking the successful analysis on IntelOwl.
- `OpenCTI`: automatically creates an observable and a linked report on your OpenCTI instance, linking the the successful analysis on IntelOwl.
- `YETI`: YETI = Your Everyday Threat Intelligence. find or create observable on YETI, linking the successful analysis on IntelOwl.

#### Connectors customization

Connectors being optional are `enabled` by default.
You can disable them or create new connectors based on already existing modules by changing the configuration values inside the Django Admin interface at: `/admin/connectors_manager/connectorreport/`.


The following are all the keys that you can change without touching the source code:
 
- `name`: _same as analyzers_
- `description`: _same as analyzers_
- `python_module`: _same as analyzers_ 
- `disabled`: _same as analyzers_
- `config`:
  - `queue`: _same as analyzers_
  - `soft_time_limit`: _same as analyzers_

- `maximum_tlp` (default `CLEAR`, choices `CLEAR`, `GREEN`, `AMBER`, `RED`): specify the maximum TLP of the analysis up to which the connector is allowed to run. (e.g. if `maximum_tlp` is `GREEN`, it would run for analysis with TLPs `WHITE` and `GREEN`). To learn more about TLPs see [TLP Support](./Usage.md#tlp-support).
- `run_on_failure` (default: `true`): if they can be run even if the job has status `reported_with_fails` 

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
Changing other keys can break a connector. In that case, you should think about duplicating the configuration entry or python module with your changes.
</div>

### Managing Analyzers and Connectors

All plugins i.e. analyzers and connectors have `kill` and `retry` actions. In addition to that, all docker-based analyzers and connectors have a `healthcheck` action to check if their associated instances are up or not.

- **kill:**

  To stop a plugin whose status is `running`/`pending`:

  - GUI: Buttons on reports table on job result page.
  - PyIntelOwl: `IntelOwl.kill_analyzer` and `IntelOwl.kill_connector` function.
  - CLI: `$ pyintelowl jobs kill-analyzer <job_id> <analyzer_name>` and `$ pyintelowl jobs kill-connector <job_id> <connector_name>`
  - API: `PATCH /api/job/{job_id}/analyzer/{analyzer_name}/kill` and `PATCH /api/job/{job_id}/connector/{connector_name}/kill`

- **retry:**

  To retry a plugin whose status is `failed`/`killed`:

  - GUI: Buttons on reports table on job result page.
  - PyIntelOwl: `IntelOwl.retry_analyzer` and `IntelOwl.retry_connector` function,
  - CLI: `$ pyintelowl jobs retry-analyzer <job_id> <analyzer_name>` and `$ pyintelowl jobs retry-connector <job_id> <connector_name>`
  - API: `PATCH /api/job/{job_id}/analyzer/{analyzer_name}/retry` and `PATCH /api/job/{job_id}/connector/{connector_name}/retry`

- **healthcheck:**

  To check if docker container or external platform associated with an analyzer or connector respectively are up or not:

  - GUI: Buttons on analyzers table and connectors table.
  - PyIntelOwl: `IntelOwl.analyzer_healthcheck` and `IntelOwl.connector_healthcheck` methods.
  - CLI: `$ pyintelowl analyzer-healthcheck <analyzer_name>` and `$ pyintelowl connector-healthcheck <connector_name>`
  - API: `GET /api/analyzer/{analyzer_name}/healthcheck` and `GET /api /connector/{connector_name}/healthcheck`

### Visualizers

With IntelOwl v5 we introduced a new plugin type called **Visualizers**.
You can leverage it as a framework to create _custom aggregated and simplified visualization of analyzer results_.

Visualizers are designed to run after the analyzers and the connectors.
The visualizer adds logic after the computations, allowing to show the final result in a different way than merely the list of reports.

Each visualizer must define a set of analyzers and connectors as requirement:
in fact the visualizers can not be chosen at the time of Job creation (once you click into the `Scan` button) but every single visualizer that it is configured and that has its requirements satisfied will be automatically selected and executed.

This framework is extremely powerful and allows every user to customize the GUI as they wish. But you know...with great power comes great responsability. To fully leverage this framework, you would need to put some effort in place. You would need to understand which data is useful for you and then write few code lines that would create your own GUI.
To simplify the process, take example from the pre-built analyzers listed below and follow the dedicated [documentation](Contribute.html#how-to-add-a-new-visualizer).

##### List of pre-built Visualizers

- `DNS`: displays the aggregation of every DNS analyzer report
- `Yara`: displays the aggregation of every matched rule by the `Yara` Analyzer
- `Domain_Reputation`: Visualizer for the Playbook "Popular_URL_Reputation_Services"
- `IP_Reputation`: Visualizer for the Playbook "Popular_IP_Reputation_Services"


#### Visualizers customization
You can either disable or create new visualizers based on already existing modules by changing the configuration values inside the Django Admin interface: `/admin/visualizers_manager/visualizerreport/`.

The following are all the keys that you can change without touching the source code:
 
- `name`: _same as analyzers_
- `description`: _same as analyzers_
- `python_module`: _same as analyzers_ 
- `disabled`: _same as analyzers_
- `config`:
  - `queue`: _same as analyzers_
  - `soft_time_limit`: _same as analyzers_
- `analyzers`: List of analyzers that must be executed
- `connectors`: List of connectors that must be executed

### Playbooks

Playbooks are designed to be easy to share sequence of running Analyzers/Connectors on a particular kind of observable.

If you want to avoid to re-select/re-configure a particular combination of analyzers and connectors together every time, you should create a playbook out of it and use it instead. This is time saver.

This is a feature introduced since IntelOwl v4.1.0! Please provide feedback about it!

#### Playbooks List

The following is the list of the available pre-built playbooks. You can also navigate the same list via the

- Graphical Interface: once your application is up and running, go to the "Plugins" section
- [pyintelowl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl): `$ pyintelowl get-playbook-config`

##### List of pre-built playbooks

- `FREE_TO_USE_ANALYZERS`: A playbook containing all free to use analyzers.
- `Sample_Static_Analysis`: A playbook containing all analyzers that perform static analysis on files.
- `Popular_URL_Reputation_Services`: Collection of the most popular and free reputation analyzers for URLs and Domains
- `Popular_IP_Reputation_Services`: Collection of the most popular and free reputation analyzers for IP addresses

#### Playbooks customization

You can create new playbooks via the Django Admin interface at `/admin/playbooks_manager/playbookconfig/`

The following are all the keys that you can leverage/change without touching the source code:

- `analyzers`: list of analyzers to execute
- `connectors`: list of connectors to execute
- `disabled`: _similar to analyzers_
- `description`: _similar to analyzers_
- `type`: list of observable types or files supported
- `runtime_configuration`: runtime configuration for each type of plugin

Another chance to create a new playbook is to leverage the "Save as Playbook" button that you can find on the top right of the Job Result Page.
In this way, after you have done an analysis, you can save the configuration of analyzers/connectors for re-use with a single click.

Those are the only ways to do that for now. We are planning to provide more easier ways to add new playbooks in the future.

## TLP Support
The **Traffic Light Protocol** ([TLP](https://www.first.org/tlp/)) is a standard that was created to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration. 

IntelOwl is not a threat intel sharing platform, like the [MISP platform](https://www.misp-project.org/). However, IntelOwl is able to share analysis results to external platforms (via [Connectors](#connectors)) and to send possible privacy related information to external services (via [Analyzers](#analyzers)).

This is why IntelOwl does support a customized version of the **Traffic Light Protocol** (TLP): to allow the user to have a better knowledge of how their data are being shared.

Every [Analyzer](#analyzers) and [Connector](#connectors) can be configured with a `maximum_tlp` value.
Based on that value, IntelOwl understands if the specific plugin is allowed or not to run (e.g. if `maximum_tlp` is `GREEN`, it would run for analysis with TLPs `WHITE` and `GREEN` only)

These is how every available TLP value behaves once selected for an analysis execution:
1. `CLEAR`: no restriction (`WHITE` was replaced by `CLEAR` in TLP v2.0, but `WHITE` is supported for retrocompatibility)
2. `GREEN`: disable analyzers that could impact privacy
3. `AMBER`: disable analyzers that could impact privacy and limit view permissions to my group
4. `RED` (default): disable analyzers that could impact privacy, limit view permissions to my group and do not use any external service
