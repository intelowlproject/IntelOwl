# Usage

## Client
Intel Owl main objective is to provide a single API interface to query in order to retrieve threat intelligence at scale.

There are multiple ways to interact with the Intel Owl APIs,

1. IntelOwl-ng (Web Interface)

    - Inbuilt Web interface with dashboard, visualizations of analysis data, easy to use forms for requesting
    new analysis, tags management and more features
    - [Live Demo](https://intelowlclient.firebaseapp.com/)
    - Built with Angular 9 and available on [Github](https://github.com/intelowlproject/intelowl-ng).

2. pyIntelOwl (CLI/Library) ["How to use" Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpd6Kt9EZdI)

    - Official client that is available at: [PyIntelOwl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl),
    - Can be used as a library for your own python projects or...
    - directly via the command line interface.

### Tokens creation
The server authentication is managed by API keys. So, if you want to interact with Intel Owl, you have to create one or more unprivileged users from the Django Admin Interface and then generate a token for those users.
Afterwards you can leverage the created tokens with the Intel Owl Client.

#### [Additional analyzers](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/develop/Advanced-Usage.html#optional-analyzers) that can be enabled per your wish.

## Analyzers customization
You can create new analyzers based on already existing modules by changing the configuration values inside `configuration/analyzer_config.json`. This file is mounted as a docker volume, so you won't need to rebuild the image.

The following are all the keys that you can change without touching the source code:
* `disabled`: you can choose to disable certain analyzers, then they won't appear in the dropdown list and won't run if requested.
* `leaks_info`: if set, in the case you specify via the API that a resource is sensitive, the specific analyzer won't be executed
* `external_service`: if set, in the case you specify via the API to exclude external services, the specific analyzer won't be executed
* `supported_filetypes`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze a file with a different mimetype from the ones you specified, it won't be executed
* `not_supported_filetypes`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze a file with a mimetype from the ones you specified, it won't be executed
* `observable_supported`: can be populated as a list. If set, if you ask to analyze an observable that is not in this list, it won't be executed. Valid values are: `ip`, `domain`, `url`, `hash`
* `soft_time_limit`: this is the maximum time (in seconds) of execution for an analyzer. Once reached, the task will be killed (or managed in the code by a custom Exception). Default 300s
* `queue`: this takes effects only when [multi-queue](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/develop/Advanced-Usage.html#multi-queue) is enabled. Choose which celery worker would execute the task: `local` (ideal for tasks that leverage local applications like Yara), `long` (ideal for long tasks) or `default` (ideal for simple webAPI-based analyzers).

Also, you can change the name of every available analyzer based on your wishes.

Changing other keys will break the analyzer. In that case, you should think about create a new python module or to modify an existing one.
