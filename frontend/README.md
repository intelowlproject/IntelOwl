# IntelOwl - frontend

Built with [@certego/certego-ui](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui).

## Design thesis

- Re-usable components/hooks/stores that other projects can also benefit from should be added to [certego-ui](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui) package.
- IntelOwl specific:
  - components should be added to `src/components/common`.
  - general hooks should be added to `src/hooks`.
  - zustand stores hooks should be added to `src/stores`.

## Local Development Environment

The frontend inside the docker containers does not hot-reload, so
you need to use `CRA dev server` on your host machine to serve pages when doing development on the frontend, using docker nginx only as API source.

- Start IntelOwl containers (see [docs](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html)). Original dockerized app is accessible on `http://localhost:80`

- Install npm packages locally
```bash
cd ./frontend && npm install
```  

- Start CRA dev server:
```bash
npm start
```

- Now you can access the auto-reloading frontend on `http://localhost:3000`. It acts as proxy for API requests to original app web server.

- JS app main configs are available in `package.json`, `craco.config.js` and `enviroments.js`.

- (optional) Use local build of `certego-ui` package so it can also hot-reload. This is useful when you want to make changes in certego-ui and rapidly test them with IntelOwl. Refer [here](https://github.com/certego/certego-ui#use-local-build-of-certego-ui-with-hot-reload-for-faster-development) for setup instructions.

## Miscellaneous

### Why do we need the `@craco/craco` package ?

For 2 reasons:

- Required for using [@welldone-software/why-did-you-render](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) package which helps us identify whether the pure components are actually working as intended or not.
- Required for using local build of `certego-ui` package. If you see line 38 onwards in the `craco.config.js` file there exists some package aliases to avoid conflicts in dependencies that are common in IntelOwl frontend and certego-ui.

### Dependabot

We have depandabot enabled for the React.js frontend application. The updates are scheduled for once a week.
