### Dependabot

We have depandabot enabled for the React.js frontend application. The updates are scheduled for once a week.

> In my experience, using dependabot with JavaScript applications has issues with package manangement. Dependabot makes pull request updating the `package-lock.json` file which is not supposed to be edited by any user/application other than npm itself.

### Generating licenses.txt
