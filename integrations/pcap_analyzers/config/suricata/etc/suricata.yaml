# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each

# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if that time elapses
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero). "bypassed"
# timeout controls locally bypassed flows. For these flows we don't do any other
# tracking. If no packets have been seen after this timeout, the flow is discarded.
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables

## Performance tuning and profiling
##

# The detection engine builds internal groups of signatures. The engine
# allows us to specify the profile to use for them, to manage memory in an
# efficient way keeping good performance. For the profile keyword you
# can use the words "low", "medium", "high" or "custom". If you use custom,
# make sure to define the values in the "custom-values" section.
# Usually you would prefer medium/high/low.
#
# "sgh mpm-context", indicates how the staging should allot mpm contexts for
# the signature groups.  "single" indicates the use of a single context for
# all the signature group heads.  "full" indicates a mpm-context for each
# group head.  "auto" lets the engine decide the distribution of contexts
# based on the information the engine gathers on the patterns from each
# group head.
#
# The option inspection-recursion-limit is used to limit the recursive calls
# in the content inspection code.  For certain payload-sig combinations, we
# might end up taking too much time in the content inspection code.
# If the argument specified is 0, the engine uses an internally defined
# default limit.  When a value is not specified, there are no limits on the recursion.

  # the grouping values above control how many groups are created per

# Select the multi pattern algorithm you want to run for scan/search the
# in the engine.
#
# The supported algorithms are:
# "ac"      - Aho-Corasick, default implementation
# "ac-bs"   - Aho-Corasick, reduced memory implementation
# "ac-ks"   - Aho-Corasick, "Ken Steele" variant
# "hs"      - Hyperscan, available when built with Hyperscan support
#
# The default mpm-algo value of "auto" will use "hs" if Hyperscan is
# available, "ac" otherwise.
#
# The mpm you choose also decides the distribution of mpm contexts for
# signature groups, specified by the conf - "detect.sgh-mpm-context".
# Selecting "ac" as the mpm would require "detect.sgh-mpm-context"
# to be set to "single", because of ac's memory requirements, unless the
# ruleset is small enough to fit in memory, in which case one can
# use "full" with "ac".  The rest of the mpms can be run in "full" mode.

  # By default Suricata creates one "detect" thread per available CPU/CPU core.
  # This setting allows controlling this behaviour. A ratio setting of 2 will
  # create 2 detect threads for each CPU/CPU core. So for a dual core CPU this
  # will result in 4 detect threads. If values below 1 are used, less threads
  # are created. So on a dual core CPU a setting of 0.5 results in 1 detect
  # thread being created. Regardless of the setting at a minimum 1 detect
  # thread will always be created.
